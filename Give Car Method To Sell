Step 1: Grab any "low class" car off the street.

Step 2: Drive to a Garage.

Step 3: Go to "Menu Name" -> Vehicle -> Spawner -> Settings -> make sure "Upgraded" is ticked.

Step 4: Locate "Future Shock Deathbike" on your spawner and hover over select.

Step 4: Drive the stolen vehicle from the street into the garage.

Step 5: As soon as the drive-in cutscene starts, spam-spawn a "Future Shock Deathbike" under motorcycles.

Step 6: Once in garage get on it, and drive to LSC to sell it for exactly 1mil.

Step 7: Repeat and Profit.

ONLY DO THIS WHEN NECESSARY. I HIGHLY ADVISE AGAINST OVER USING THIS. NO GUARANTEE THAT THIS IS SAFE.
